`I am writing to express my strong interest in the opportunity you are offering. As a graduate master’s student in Information Systems and Applications from National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, I am excited to apply my technical skills and experiences to contribute to your team.

With a bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering and a background in Computer Systems Engineering, I have developed a solid foundation in data analysis, and IT tools. My professional experience includes working as a Project Engineer at Ingea, where I successfully migrated a critical cement blocker production line and developed and programmed a PLC for a clothing fabric machine, resulting in improved production time. I also have experience in ERP software technical support, Scada system development, and installation of electrical metering devices, using tools such as TIA Portal, RSLogix500, and PME (Power Monitoring System). In the regards of electrical metering I have worked with both hardware and software Schneider Electric Products.

During my master’s program, I have gained hands-on experience in various data analysis techniques, including CNN, LSTM, Autoencoder, Random Forest, Densenet, and Deep Neural Networks. I am proficient in data preprocessing, data cleansing, and using tools such as TensorFlow, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn for machine learning tasks. I also have experience with spatial and graph databases like PostgreSQL and Neo4j. Additionally, I have worked on data analysis projects using MATLAB and EEGLAB for brainwave analysis and cleaning.

As a bilingual professional with fluency in English and Spanish, I am able to effectively communicate and collaborate with diverse teams. I also have some knowledge in AWS services such as S3, Lambda, Glue, CloudWatch, and Redshift, and I am continuously seeking opportunities to expand my skillset and stay up to date with the latest industry trends.

I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and have a strong problem-solving mindset. I am confident that my technical skills, along with my ability to adapt quickly and learn continuously, make me a suitable candidate for this data role. I am eager to contribute my expertise to your organization and help drive data-driven decisions for business success. 

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experiences align with your organization's needs in further detail.

Sincerely,
